<!-- Notes
-----
- I'm an individual on the autism spectrum. I deeply value the interactions with other people and want to ensure you understand that my communication style may sometimes differ from what you're accustomed to. E.g., if you notice that I speak with less intonation or emotional expression, either in Chinese or English, please know that this is a part of my neurodiversity. It doesn't mean I'm not enthusiastic or positive; it's simply my unique way of communicating. I sincerely appreciate your patience and understanding. -->
