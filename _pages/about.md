I am a PhD student under the supervision of [K. K. Ramakrishnan](https://kknetsyslab.cs.ucr.edu/) in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Riverside. I work mainly on networked systems, with a special interest in system I/O. I have also done some work on resource management for cloud systems.
