- (Nov. 2023) We have evolved our high-performance 5GC solution to [L25GC+](./papers/l25gc+.pdf). This new version tackles many of the pain points we encountered while developing the predecessor [L25GC](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544216.3544267). I highly recommend you read the [paper](./papers/l25gc+.pdf) or check out the [code](https://github.com/nycu-ucr/L25GC-plus.git) of L25GC+.

<!-- Notes

- I'm an individual on the autism spectrum. I deeply value the interactions with other people and want to ensure you understand that my communication style may sometimes differ from what you're accustomed to. E.g., if you notice that I speak with less intonation or emotional expression, either in Chinese or English, please know that this is a part of my neurodiversity. It doesn't mean I'm not enthusiastic or positive; it's simply my unique way of communicating. I sincerely appreciate your patience and understanding. -->
